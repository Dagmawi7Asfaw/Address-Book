## Class Description

The `ConnectionFactory` class facilitates database connections by encapsulating the details of connection setup and management. It ensures that a valid connection is available for database operations and handles exceptions related to database connectivity. The class uses JDBC to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database.

## Constructor

### `ConnectionFactory()`

```java
public ConnectionFactory()
```

**Description:**
Initializes a new instance of the `ConnectionFactory` class. The constructor attempts to load the JDBC driver and establish a connection to the database.

**Throws:**
- `RuntimeException` - If the driver class cannot be found or a SQL exception occurs during connection initialization.

## Methods

### `getConnection()`

```java
public Connection getConnection()
```

**Returns:** `Connection` - A valid connection to the database.

**Description:**
